    <!-- Chosen Palette: Slate Gray & Amber -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as an educational tool with a two-column layout. A fixed sidebar on the left lists various diseases for easy navigation. The main content area on the right dynamically displays protocol information for the selected disease. This structure was chosen for its intuitiveness, allowing a student to easily switch between different therapeutic areas and compare protocol designs. The content for each disease is further organized into Phase II and Phase III tabs, breaking down complex information into digestible, phase-specific sections (Objectives, Criteria, etc.). This guided, exploratory flow is ideal for learning and reference. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        1. Clinical Trial Phases Diagram -> Goal: Inform/Contextualize -> Method: HTML/Tailwind styled diagram -> Interaction: None, static visual aid -> Justification: Provides a foundational overview of the entire clinical trial process, which is essential context for a student. Avoids complex libraries for a simple, clear visual.
        2. Phase II vs. Phase III Characteristics Chart -> Goal: Compare -> Method: Grouped Bar Chart -> Interaction: Hover tooltips for precise data -> Justification: Visually quantifies the significant differences in scale (patients, duration) between exploratory and confirmatory phases, making the distinction memorable. -> Library: Chart.js (Canvas).
        3. Protocol Details (Objectives, Criteria) -> Goal: Inform/Detail -> Method: Structured text in styled cards and lists -> Interaction: Users select a disease from the sidebar and toggle between Phase II/III tabs. -> Justification: Detailed protocol elements are best presented as clear, well-organized text. Cards and lists enhance readability and separate distinct concepts effectively. -> Library: HTML/Tailwind for structure. -->
